    Promises explaned in simple way here
     "Producing code" is code that can take some time
    "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result
       A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code
    -->  
    <!--
        A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code:
        Promise Syntax:
            let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
            // "Producing Code" (May take some time)

            myResolve(); // when successful
            myReject();  // when error
            });

            // "Consuming Code" (Must wait for a fulfilled Promise)
            myPromise.then(
            function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
            function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
            );

            Promise Object Properties:
                A JavaScript Promise object can be:
                - Pending
                - Fulfilled
                - Rejected

                The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

                - While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
                - When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
                - When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object
            i.e: 
            myPromise.state	         myPromise.result
            "pending"	                undefined
            "fulfilled"             	a result value
            "rejected"	                an error object

           - You cannot access the Promise properties state and result.
           - You must use a Promise method to handle promises.

           Promise How To
                Here is how to use a Promise:
                myPromise.then(
                function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
                function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
                );

                Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.
                Both are optional, so you can add a callback for success or failure only.

                NOTE:
                The two arguments (resolve and reject) are pre-defined by JavaScript.
                We will not create them, but call one of them when the executor function is ready.
                Very often we will not need a reject function.
