        See previous program 39

        -> With the help of Await we have the full control of our program, what will execute first,2nd,...
        -> In JS code/instructions execute one by one suppose a(),b(),c() are some functions , JS will run a then b and then c. Suppose c needs value returned by b but b is not resolved its waiting for promise
          So, you can put await at b and make the flow to code to stop and c waits for b to return promise to use it
