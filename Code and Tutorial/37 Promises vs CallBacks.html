            //difference betwen two methods
            //In callbacks we were passing the callback function to another function
            //In promises we are attaching the callback function to a promise object

            //In callbacks: createOrder calls the function whenever it wants to
            //In Promises: In this case we will have the control of the program with us

            //In callbakcs: the createOrder API might call the function twice/3 times or it might not call it
            //In Promises: As soon as we have data inside promise it will call the function 100% that's the guarantee given the JS and it will call it only once
