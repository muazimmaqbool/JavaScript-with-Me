            function x(){
                var a=20;
                function y(){              // or return function y(){
                    console.log(a);              //console.log(a) 
                }                          //      } this is same as return y();
                return y;  
            }
            var z=x(); // calling function x and returns y into z and x() is gone. Now z contains y()
            console.log(z); // o/p function y() code

            //calling z ; (we can call this although its variable but now it contains function in it)
            z(); 
        // o/p : ? , it will print 20 , Here comes closure into picture. When functions are returned
        //from another function they still maintains their lexical scope, they remember where they were
        // actually present. So y() remembers from where it came and it remains their was something a and look fro its value
        
        //when function y() was returned not just the function code was returned but
        //the wholeclosure was also returned and it was put into z. and when you execute z() it still remembers
        // the reference to a and prints value of 'a'

        // watch at 11:55
