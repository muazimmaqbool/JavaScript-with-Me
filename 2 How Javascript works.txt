    How javascript work ?

A) Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution Context"

         You can assume this execution context to be  a big box or a container in which whole javascript code is executed.
         Think of the execution context as an box which have two sections.
        1)Memory                                                         
		In memory component all variables and functions are stored in key:value pairs . eg a:10 , func :{} 
		Memory component is also known as “ variable environment”
		So, its  like an environment in which all these variables and functions are stored as key & value pairs 

      2)Code  
	In code component , code is executed one line at a time
	Code component is also known as “Thread of Execution”


B) Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language:

	Single threaded means Javascript can execute “one command at a time” and synchronous single-thread means javascript can execute “one command at a time & in a specific order .”
	i.e it can only go to the next line ones the currently line has been finish executing
